# Todo
- update this readme
- tests
    - required tests:
    - nice to have goals:
        - write tests to validate each card as expected.
            - Ex: "replace two X cards with one Y card should net -1 card to the deck"
    - stretch goal:
        - write tests to parse/validate syntax/programatically generate cards?
        - Ex: add_one_plus_foo_card should be able to parse the "add", "plus one", and "foo"
        - should be able to work with rolling, wound, disarm, add, replace, remove, etc
        - goal would be to not need the cards.yml after this...
